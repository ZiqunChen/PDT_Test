# Pretrained Decision Transformer

This repository is based on [Decision-Pretrained Transformer](https://github.com/jon--lee/decision-pretrained-transformer). We futher apply the PDT model in the Federated Learning setting with multiple clients.

# Running Experiments
Each experiment has three phases: (1) pretraining data collection (2) pretraining (3) evaluation of the in-context algorithm.  There are files run_bandit.sh and run_bandit_FL.sh that show example usage to run these.
